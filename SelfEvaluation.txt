My goal for Artificial Intelligence was simply to gain a greater understanding of the fundamentals of AI and to explore whether that area of computer science was interesting to me. To that effect, my time in AI was well spent. While I have decided that AI is not my field of choice, I have no doubt that what I learned about how to frame problems differently will be incredibly important to my future career and education. Nowhere is this more clear than my final project, which, with some professorial advice and guidance, was rewritten from a very specialized maze-generation program to a generic series of functions that could be passed to a search function at a higher level of abstraction and portability. The many hours put into each iteration of my final project make it what I believe is my finest work in the course.
During the semester, there were times when I had some difficulty deciding how to progress. Working within the framework of pucks was fun, but my lack of complete understanding of its systems made concrete progress difficult outside of a few simple alterations, like making pucks spawn more of themselves in enormous numbers. It was not until I decided to make a maze builder that I felt comfortable working, as I was working in a language I was familiar with and designing the framework myself. This exposes a large weakness I have as a programmer in my difficulty to quickly grasp new frameworks and work well within them, a weak area I hope to eliminate through future experience programming. Overall, however, I am proud of what I learned and accomplished this semester in AI and feel I fulfilled my personal goals for the course.
