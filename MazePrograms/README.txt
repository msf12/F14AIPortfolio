My program creates a random maze. The program itself includes no real AI properties (though it did pose a super interesting problem) but considering mazes raised what I feel is a good example of the question of whether or not there are things humans can do that computers can't. I initially planned on creating a maze solving AI. While I didn't have time to implement one, I did consider it in depth and came to the conclusion that I don't believe any interesting AI could be created to solve a maze as I feel that between the two maze scenarios (seeing the whole maze at once and being inside the maze itself) there is no way to solve a maze that isn't at its heart checking every possible path.
